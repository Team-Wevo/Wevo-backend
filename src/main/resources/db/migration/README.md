# Database Migrations

Flyway SQL migrations live in this directory.

Use the naming pattern:

```text
V{version}__{description}.sql
```

Examples:

```text
V1__init_schema.sql
V2__add_project_status.sql
```

Do not edit an already-applied migration. Add a new versioned migration instead.

The initial schema migration should be added after the current entity schema is reviewed by the domain owners.
